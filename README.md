QAwareIOS
=========

QAware is a cross-platform application that is changing the way quality assurance and quality control is conducted across many industries. By integrating iBeacon technology with a native iOS app written in Objective-C, QAware ensures that inspections happen when, where and by whom they are supposed to happen. Brandon and Zach were responsible for learning enough Objective-C in two days to produce a minimum viable product that talked to hardware and made HTTP requests to a remote server. They continued to learn and innovate to produce a polished and powerful mobile application.

Clayton and Ricky worked hard on developing a flexible back-end using Ruby on Rails and creating a database that grew with the mobile app. As the mobile team were adding features, the web team was able to efficiently and dependably add tables and columns to the database while learning how to visualize real-time data using D3 and polling with JavaScript.
